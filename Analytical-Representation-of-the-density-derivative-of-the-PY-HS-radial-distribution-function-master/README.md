# Analytical Representation of the density derivative of the PY HS radial distribution function
Fortran code for the analytical density derivative of the PY HS g(r)

This is a repository for the g(r) and dg(r)/d(rho) for the Percus-Yevick hard-sphere radial distribution function.

The original code was written in Fortran 77.

A fortran 90 version was created using https://fortran.uk/plusfortonline.php to convert the f77 to f90. 

A python scipt is also available now.

If you make use of the code please cite it as
